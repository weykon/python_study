## Python Tuples
- In python, a tuple is a collection of objects which is ordered and immutable
- Created by placing sequence of elements within round () braces, separated by ‘ , ‘
- Values can be of any datatype
- Concatenation of tuples can be done by the use of ‘+’ operator
Tuples are just like lists except that the tuples are immutable i.e cannot be changed

### Example —

```python
var= (4, ‘Hello’, 5, ‘World’)

empty_tuple = ()
```

## Usage
### Tuple with items

```python
tup= (10,"Hello",3.14,"a")
print(tup)
print(type(tup))
```

out
> (10, 'Hello', 3.14, 'a')
<class 'tuple'>

## Usage

### Negative Indexing : index of -1 refers to the last item, -2 to the #second last item and so on

```python
tup = (10,"Hello",3.14,"a")
print(tup[-2])
#Reverse the tuple
print(tup[::-1])
```

out
> 3.14
('a', 3.14, 'Hello', 10)

## Usage

```python
#concatenation and repeat in Tuples
#concatenation using + operator
tup = (10,"Hello",3.14,"a")
print(tup + (50,60))
#repeat using * operator
print(tup * 2)
```

out
> (10, 'Hello', 3.14, 'a', 50, 60)
(10, 'Hello', 3.14, 'a', 10, 'Hello', 3.14, 'a')

## Usage

### membership : check if an item exists in a tuple or not, using the keyword in
```python
tup = (10,"Hello",3.14,"a")
print(10 in tup)
print("World" in tup)
```
out
> True
False

## Usage

### Iterate through Tuple : use for loop to iterate through each item #in a tuple
```python
tup = (10,"Hello",3.14,"a")
for i in tup:
    print(i)
```

out
> 10 Hello
3.14
a

## Usage

### Nested Tuple
```python
nest_tup = ((10,"Hello",3.14,"a"), (70,(8,"Mike")))
print(nest_tup)
a,b = nest_tup
print(a)
print(b)
```

out
> ((10, 'Hello', 3.14, 'a'), (70, (8, 'Mike')))
(10, 'Hello', 3.14, 'a')
(70, (8, 'Mike'))

## Usage

### Enumerate : use enumerate function
```python
tup = (10,"Hello",3.14,"a")
for i in enumerate(tup):
    print(i)
```

out
> (0, 10)
(1, 'Hello')
(2, 3.14)
(3, 'a')

# Python Sets
In python, a set is a collection of objects which is both unindexed and unordered
Sets make sure that there are no duplicate elements in the items sequence
Created by using the built-in set() function with an iterable object by placing the items inside curly {} braces, separated by ‘,’
Items can be added to the set by using built-in add() function
Items can be accessed by looping through the set using loops or using ‘in’ keyword
Items can be removed from the set by using built-in remove()

Example
```python
var= set([“Hello”, “People”, “Hello”])
```

## Usage

#Create Set
```python
set_one = {10, 20, 30, 40}
print(set_one)
#Create set from list using set()
set_two = set([10, 20, 30, 40, 30, 20])
print(set_two)
```

out
> {40, 10, 20, 30}
{40, 10, 20, 30}

## Usage

### Removing elements : Use the methods discard(), pop() and remove()

```python
#set_one is {100, 70, 40, 10, 80, 20, 60, 30}
#discard() method
set_one.discard(100)
print("After discard:",set_one)
#remove() method
set_one.remove(40)
print("After removing element :", set_one)
#pop() method
set_one.pop()
print("After removing element :", set_one)
```

out
> After discard: {70, 40, 10, 80, 20, 60, 30}
After removing element : {70, 10, 80, 20, 60, 30}
After removing element : {10, 80, 20, 60, 30}

## Usage

## Set operations
```python
X = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
Y = {40, 50, 60, 70, 80}
Z = {20, 30, 100, 50, 10}
#Union : Union of X, Y, Z is a set of all elements from all three #sets using | operator or union() method
print("Set Union:", X|Y|Z)
#Intersection :Intersection of X, Y, Z is a set of all elements from #all three sets using & operator or intersection()
print("Set Intersection:", X&Y&Z)
#Difference : Difference of X, Y is a set of all elements from both #sets using - operator or difference()
print("Set Difference:", X-Y)
# Symmetric Difference : Symmetric Difference of X, Y, Z is a set of #all elements from all three sets using ^ operator or #symmetric_difference()
print("Set Symmetric Difference:", X^Y^Z)
```

out
> Set Union: {100, 70, 40, 10, 80, 50, 20, 60, 30}
Set Intersection: {50}
Set Difference: {10, 20, 30}
Set Symmetric Difference: {80, 50, 100, 70, 60}

## Usage
```python
#enumerate : Returns an enumerate object which contains the index #and value for all the items of the set as a pair
set_one = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 30}
for i in enumerate(set_one):
    print(i)
```

out
> (0, 40)
(1, 10)
(2, 50)
(3, 20)
(4, 30)

## Usage
```python
#Frozenset : set which has the characteristics of a set, but its elements cannot be changed once assigned
X = frozenset([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
Y = frozenset([40, 50, 60, 70, 80])
print(X.union(Y))
```

out
> frozenset({70, 40, 10, 80, 50, 20, 60, 30})
Loops in Python
If, Elif and Else Statements —

In python, If, Elif and Else statements are used to facilitate decision making i.e when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied.
In the example below, the program evaluates the test expression and will execute statement(s) only if the test expression is True. If the test expression1 is False, then it checks elif test expression 2 and if that’s also False, then at last it goes to else and executed else statement.

```python
if test_expression1:
statement(s)
elif test_expression2:
statements(s)
else :
statement
```

Python interprets non-zero values as True. None and 0 are interpreted as False.
The if block can have only one else block but there can be multiple elif blocks.
While loops —

In python, while loop is used to traverse/iterate over a block of code as long as the test condition is true
In the example below, test_expression is checked first. The body of the loop is entered only if the test_expression evaluates to True. The loop continues till the test condition becomes False.
while test_expression:

Do this

Example :
```python
while i <= 10:

sum = sum — i

i = i+1
```

For Loops and Range function —

In python, for loop is used to traverse/iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string etc)
In the example below, i is the variable that takes the value of the item inside the sequence on each iteration. Loop continues until we reach the last item in the sequence
for i in sequence:

Do this

Range ( range()) is used to generate sequence of numbers where the syntax of range is
range(start, stop, step_size)

Example :
```python
for i in range(len(list1)):

print(“The element is “, list1[i])
```

## Usage
```python
price = 200
if price > 120:
    print("Price is greater than 120")
elif price == 120:
    print("Price is 120")
elif price < 120:
    print("Price is less than 120")
else:
    print("Exit")
```

out
> Price is greater than 120

## Usage

# If, Elif and Else one liner
```python
x = 200

var = {x < 190: "Condition one satisfied",
       x != 200: "Condition two satisfied"}.get(True, "Condition third satisfied")

print(var)
```

out
> Condition third satisfied

## Usage
```python
#while with else statement
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
```

out
> 1
2
3
4
5
i is no longer less than 6

## Usage
```python
# for loop with range function
days =['sunday','monday','tuesday']
for i in range(len(days)):
    print("Today is", days[i])
```

out
> Today is sunday
Today is monday
Today is tuesday
Break and Continue Statement
In python, we can use break statement when we want to terminate the current loop without checking test condition
Once terminated using the break statement, the control of the program goes to the statement immediately after the body of the loop
Example :
```python
for value in list1:

if value == “t”:

break

print(value)
```

In python, we can use continue statement when we want to skip the rest of the code for the current loop iteration
Example :
```python
for value in list1:

if value == “t”:

continue

print(value)
```

## Usage
```python
#break statement
count = 0
while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 10:
        break
print('exit')
```

out
> 0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
exit

## Usage
```python
#Continue statement
for x in range(15):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(x)
```

out
> 1

## Input Output in Python
In python, there are two inbuilt functions to read the input from the user
raw_input ( ) function : reads one line from user input and returns it as a string

input ( ) function : Similar to raw_input, except it evaluates the user expression

For multiple user inputs, we can use —
split() method

List comprehension

In python, output is using the print() function
String literals in print() statement are used to format the output
- \n : Add blank new line

- “” : To print an empty line.

end keyword is used to print specific content at the end of the execution of the print() function
Example —
```python
num= input(“Enter the number: “)

str = raw_input(“Enter your input: “)

print(“Python” , end = ‘**’)
```

One of the best article I read for Python Data Structures by
Eyal Trabelsi


## Usage
```python
# input
num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
```

out
> Enter a number: 50

## Usage
```python
num = 5
print('The value of num is', num)
print("The value is %d" %num)
```

out
> The value of num is 5
The value is 5

## Python Object Oriented Programming
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language and supports Object Oriented programming. In Python everything is a object. An object has two characteristics : Attributes and Behavior
Principles of object-oriented programming system are —
- Class

- Object

- Method

- Inheritance

- Polymorphism

- Encapsulation

### Class and constructor —
It’s a blueprint for the object. In python we use the class keyword to define class. Class constructor is used to assign the values to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created.

- Object — It’s an instantiation of a class.

- Method — It’s a function that is associated with an object

- Inheritance — Specifies that the child object acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent object.

- Polymorphism — Refers to functions having the same names but carrying different functionalities.

- Encapsulation — To prevents data from direct modification, we can restrict access to methods and variables in python

### Attributes and Class in Python
In Python, a class is blueprint of the object
To define a class, we use the keyword “class” following the class name and - -

semicolon —
class class_name:

### Body of the class

Object — It’s an instantiation of a class. The object instance contains real data or value
To create an instance :
```python
obj1 = class_name()

Class constructor — to assign the values to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created, we use constructor. The __init__() method is called constructor method
class class_name:

def __init__(self, parameters):

self.param1 = parameters
```
Instance attributes refer to the attributes inside the constructor method. Class attributes refer to the attributes outside the constructor method
Method — It’s a function that is associated with an object, used to describe the behavior of the objects
def method_name(self)


## Usage

### Class Usage
class cat:
```python
def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_breed):
        self.name = cat_name
        self.age = cat_breed
```

## Usage
```python
#Class attribute and Instance Attribute
class emp:
    x = 10      #class attribute
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = 'Steve'
        self.salary = 10000

    def display(self):
        print(self.name)
        print(self.salary)

obj_emp = emp()
print("Dictionary conversion:", vars(obj_emp))
```

out
> Dictionary conversion: {'name': 'Steve', 'salary': 10000}
